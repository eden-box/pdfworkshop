## Configuration
| name       | default     | description                                                      |
|------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| input_dir  | ./          | Directory where PDF files will be collected from.                |
| output_dir | ./output/   | Directory where the compressed PDF files will be stored.         |
| public_key | ""          | Your public API key.                                                     |
| suffix     | ""          | The suffix given to compressed files (before the extension).     |
| recursive  | False       | Boolean indicating if input_dir must be scanned recursively. |

The public_key value must be defined before using the tool for the first time.
The required public key can be obtained by creating a developer account on [iLovePDF](https://developer.ilovepdf.com/).
Any value can be configured using:
```bash
pdfworkshop config <config_name> <new_config_value>
```

## Commands
- list-config - list configuration values
- config \<option\> \<value\> - edit tool configuration values
- run - compress all PDF files stored in input_dir, storing the result in output_dir

## How to use
By default, the PDF files to compress should be on the directory from where the tool will be called.
After using the _run_ command, an _output_ directory will be created, where all compressed
files will be stored.

## Example run

To exercise some of the available commands, one can try to:

- List the current configuration
```bash
pdfworkshop list-config
```
- Define the API public_key value
```bash
pdfworkshop config public_key <new_public_key>
```

```
